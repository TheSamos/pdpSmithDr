\section{Debugging and testing}

\subsection{Assertions}
Assert can be used to check pre and post conditions for example.\\
It ensures that code is correct and also documents code.\\
Assert has absolutely no impact on performances when code is compiled
with -DNDEBUG.\\

For example:
\begin{algorithm}[H]
\#include <cassert> \\
 \\
int f(int n) \{ \\
\codeindent{1}assert(n>3); \\
\codeindent{1}const int result = g(n); \\
 \\
\codeindent{1}assert(result>=6); \\
\codeindent{1}return result; \\
\}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Memory leaks}
{\bf Valgrind} is a very helpful tool suite to debug programs (to
check memory leaks, to assess performance, ...).\\
It is highly recommended to check memory accesses of your program
using valgrind {\bf memcheck} tool.\\
See page on Valgrind
page~\footnote{http://www.cprogramming.com/debugging/valgrind.html}
for more information.
